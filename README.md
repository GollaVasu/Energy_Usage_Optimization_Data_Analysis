## Project Scope

This project investigates the relationship between energy usage and production efficiency in a glass manufacturing plant. By analyzing historical energy consumption and operational data, we identified patterns and inefficiencies in the manufacturing process that contribute to excessive energy usage.

Key areas of focus:
- **Energy consumption** at various stages of production (e.g., melting, forming, cooling).
- **Identification of energy inefficiencies** due to machine idle time, equipment maintenance schedules, and suboptimal operational practices.
- **Proposing optimization strategies** to minimize energy usage without affecting production levels or product quality.

## Data Overview

The data used in this project includes:
- **Energy consumption data**: Time-series data on energy consumption per machine and per shift.
- **Production data**: Number of units produced, machine uptime, and production rates.
- **Environmental data**: External factors that influence energy consumption (e.g., ambient temperature, weather conditions).
- **Maintenance logs**: Information about machine downtimes and maintenance schedules, which could lead to energy inefficiencies.

### Data Sources:
- Energy meters and SCADA systems that record energy usage.
- Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system for production data.
- Machine maintenance management system.

## Methodology

### 1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Collected energy consumption data from sensors and external databases.
   - Cleaned and preprocessed the data using Python (pandas) and SQL to remove outliers, handle missing values, and standardize data formats.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conducted EDA to uncover patterns and trends in energy usage.
   - Identified correlations between energy consumption and key production parameters (e.g., machine downtime, production volumes).

### 3. **Optimization Strategies**:
   - Developed predictive models to forecast energy consumption under different operational scenarios.
   - Applied optimization techniques to recommend strategies for reducing energy waste (e.g., better machine scheduling, reducing idle times).

### 4. **Interactive Dashboards**:
   - Developed interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize energy consumption trends, KPIs, and production performance metrics.
   - Dashboards provided actionable insights for plant managers to monitor energy usage in real time and make informed decisions.
